# AI Search Algorithms with PyAmaze

This repository is a learning resource for understanding and implementing various AI Search Algorithms, including Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Dijkstra's Algorithm, and A* Search Algorithm. These algorithms are implemented using the PyAmaze library in Python.

## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) search algorithms play a crucial role in solving various problems, from route planning to puzzle solving. This repository provides a hands-on approach to learning and implementing these algorithms using Python and the PyAmaze library.

## Algorithms Implemented

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: This algorithm explores all nodes at the current depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It is used for unweighted graph traversal and pathfinding.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: DFS explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking. It is often used in maze solving and can be implemented recursively or using a stack.

3. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: This algorithm finds the shortest path in a weighted graph by maintaining the shortest distance to each node from the start node. It is used for solving the single-source shortest path problem.

4. **A* Search Algorithm**: A* is an informed search algorithm that uses a heuristic to guide the search towards the goal. It is widely used in pathfinding and optimization problems.
